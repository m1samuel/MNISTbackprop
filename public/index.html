        <p>Parallel Three-Dimensional Fast Fourier Transforms, dubbed P3DFFT, is a library for large-scale computer simulations 
            on parallel platforms. 3D FFT is an important algorithm for simulations in a wide range of fields, including 
            studies of turbulence, climatology, astrophysics and material science. This project was initiated at 
            <a href="http://www.sdsc.edu" rel="nofollow">San Diego Supercomputer Center (SDSC)</a> at UC San Diego by its main 
            author Dmitry Pekurovsky, Ph.D.</p>
        
        <p>P3DFFT uses 2D, or pencil, decomposition. This overcomes an important limitation to scalability inherent in FFT 
            libraries implementing 1D (or slab) decomposition: the number of processors/tasks used to run this problem in 
            parallel can be as large as N^2, were N is the linear problem size. This approach has shown good scalability up to 
            131,072 cores. P3DFFT is optimized for large data sets.</br>
        
        <p>P3DFFT is written in Fortran90/MPI and is optimized for parallel performance. C interface is available, as are 
            detailed documentation and examples in both Fortran and C.  A configure script is supplied for ease of 
            installation. This package depends on a serial  FFT library such as 
            <a href="http://fftw.org/" rel="nofollow">Fastest Fourier Transform in the West</a> (FFTW) or IBM&#x27;s 
            <a href="http://www-03.ibm.com/systems/software/essl/index.html" rel="nofollow">ESSL</a>.</p>
        
    <p>In the forward transform, given an input of an array of 3D real values, an output of 3D complex array 
            of Fourier coefficients is returned. Current features include:
    </p>  
    <ul>
        <li>real-to-complex/complex-to-real FFT in 3D </li>
        <li>real-to-complex FFT in 2D followed by sine/cosine/Chebyshev/empty transform, and the reverse for 
            backward transform.  </li>
        <li>pruned transforms (less than full input or output) </li>
        <li>in-place or out-of-place transforms </li>
        <li>multi-variable transforms </li>
    </ul>
